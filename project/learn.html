        <p>Chess is a strategic board game for two players, where each player controls a set of 16 pieces of 6 types on
            a chessboard. Every piece has its own unique way of moving. The primary objective is to achieve checkmate,
            which happens when the opponent&#039s king is in the position of capture without any possible escape. Apart
            from
            checkmate, games can conclude in different ways, including resignation by a player or a draw, which can be
            achieved through various means.</p>
        <ul>

                <h4>Two-player game: </h4>
                <p>Chess is played between two players, referred to as White and Black. Each player controls a set of
                    chess pieces in their respective colors. Typically, White moves first in chess. This is determined
                    either by mutual agreement or by a random method such as flipping a coin.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Six types of pieces: </h4>
                <p>The chessboard starts with each player having 16 pieces, which include the king, queen, rooks,
                    bishops, knights, and pawns. Each type of piece has its own unique way of moving across the board.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Checkmate: </h4>
                <p>The ultimate goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent&#039s king. Checkmate occurs when the king
                    is
                    under attack (in check) and there is no legal move to remove the threat. If a player checkmates
                    their opponent, they win the game.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Other ways to end the game: </h4>
                <p>Besides checkmate, there are several ways a game can end:
                <ul>
                    <li>Resignation</li>
                    <li>Draw</li>
                    <li>Agreement</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>Understanding and adhering to the rules of chess is crucial for fair play and effective competition. It
            ensures that the game is played in a structured manner and allows for consistent evaluation of positions and
            outcomes.</p>
